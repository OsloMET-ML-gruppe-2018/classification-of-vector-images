### Pourpose
Distribute the project dataset to the members, investigate best methods for making the dataset and the results availible to all members and work on finding suitable, already trained ML models to test the dataset on.

### Discussion
We hit abit of a wall on in the search of the best platform to host the dataset. The size of the dataset and our need for high availability limits our options.
We created the our Github organization and repository for the project and generated the raw project layout using
[cookie-cutter data-science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

### Action points
 The group members will invidually read-up on the project space and technologies. 
 Research trained ML models
