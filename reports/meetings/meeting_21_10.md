### Pourpose
The group has been preoccupied by other courses. Part of this meetings pourpose is to re-synchronise the whole group on the tasks at hand and where we are at the moment. 

#### Continuing the work on the project:

 - Make dataset acessable in an api friendly manner
 - Finalize choice of features to focus on
 - Start testing the dataset in our focus features
 

### Discussion
We have chosen to upload the dataset to Google Drive hosted under a newly created user. Google Drive was demed suitable as it provides a low-bar entry to both upload the files and download them programaticaly. Other services like AWS and Google Cloud Storage provided better support but with substantialy more upfront configuration cost. As the project has already been delayed by other courses the Google Drive solution was agreed upon.

THe group has searched through online sources for a suitable trained model to test our data with. As of now we have not found a suitable model that matches our focus features. We have of this meeting decided to move forward with training our own model to test the PNG images.

##### Focus features:
 - Collections
 - Single element
