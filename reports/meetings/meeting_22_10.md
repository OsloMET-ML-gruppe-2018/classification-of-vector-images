### Pourpose
After finding out that we may have an issue with a dirty dataset, we need to check the categories for duplicates. 
This wil determen what we can use forward.


### Discussion
We made scripts to compare the categories against each other to look for douplicates. After we have gathered all the results and evalueted
them, we will schedule a meeting with Henrik Lieng to see if the dataset is good enough and what to focus on in the last month of the project.
