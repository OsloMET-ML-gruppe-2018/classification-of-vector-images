### Project Background
We have recently at OsloMet gathered a dataset for vector graphical 
images. These images are in the public domain and uploaded by artists 
and designers. The type of data is SVG, AI, and EPS.
Although there are several published datasets for vector graphics, this 
is the first dataset for general vector graphics. The dataset contains 
almost 250 thousand images and is to our knowledge the first and 
largest dataset of its type. The dataset is not yet published.

### Project Aim
In this project we want to explore whether the dataset is suitable for 
standard classification of vector graphics images. Vector graphical 
imagery is different to raster images and we want to investigate the 
performance of standard classification for raster images used with 
vector images.

### Key activities:

 - Use a current framework for machine learning to setup classifiers for raster and vector images

 - Test the performance on the classifiers for our labels (these are noisy labels supplied by uploaders via “tags”)

 - Test the performance across different “categories”, such as abstract imagery, cards, objects etc.

 - If time, explore approaches to deal with the “level of noise” in the labels
 
### Final deliverable 
Case report outlining the method used and the result on classification. 
This is part of a research project and it is expected that the work is 
incorporated into a scientific article.
